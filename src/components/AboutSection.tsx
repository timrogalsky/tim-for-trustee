              I'm a Charleswood resident, a husband, father, educator, and musician, with experience as a roofing contractor and high school basketball coach.

              I've spent my career teaching mathematics at Canadian Mennonite University, 
              where I guide students to think critically, work collaboratively, and pursue their passions for making the world a better place.

              I believe education is a sacred trust. Our schools are the heart of our community â€” 
              they are where our kids grow, where families connect, and where our future is being 
              shaped every day.
