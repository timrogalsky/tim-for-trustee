            <p>
              I've spent my career teaching mathematics at Canadian Mennonite University, 
              where I help students think critically, work collaboratively, and find joy in learning.

              I believe education is a sacred trust. Our schools are the heart of our community â€” 
              they are where our kids grow, where families connect, and where our future is being 
              shaped every day.
